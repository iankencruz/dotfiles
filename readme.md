Once installed, install these plugins for QoL:

### fish-ss-agent - [https://github.com/danhper/fish-ssh-agent]
Utility functions to start your ssh agent when using fish shell. You will only need to run ssh-add and type your password once, after the running ssh_agent should do the work for you.

### nvm.fish - [https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish]
A tool lets you juggle multiple active Node versions in a single local environment. Install and switch between runtimes like a boss, without messing up your home directory or breaking system-wide scripts.
